# pytorch-ssd
Train a model on ssd-mobilenet on google colab!

## Prepare your dataset

I used Labelimg to label this dataset. Create a virtual environment on your computer. Run this command `pip install labelimg` and to start it, run `labelimg.exe`. From there you will be able to open your images directory and open the directory in which you want your labels to be in.

Now, click on the PASCAL VOC that you see on the left sidebar. Click on it until you get YOLO.

Keyboard Shortcuts:

W: write

D: next image

A: last image

Ctrl+s or Cmd+s: save labels

## Now that your dataset is complete, open the SSD_MobileNet_Training.ipynb in Google Colab.
